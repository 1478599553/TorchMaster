# TorchMaster
This mod adds the **Mega Torch**, a special torch that prevents hostile mobs from spawning in a configurable radius around the torch.
The idea of this mod originates from the **Magnum Torch** (ExtraUtilities by [RWTema](https://github.com/rwtema)).

In version 1.1 the mod also adds the **Terrain Lighter**, a block that lights up the terrain around the block using torches and some furnace fuel.

Version 1.2.0 added the **Dread Lamp** - a lamp that works similar to the mega torch but prevents the natural spawn of passive mobs ("animals") instead:
Bat, Ocelot, Squid, Pig, Sheep, Cow, Chicken, Rabbit, Wolf, Horse (including Zombie Horse!), Llama and other Entities which implement IAnimals. Breeding animals will still work inside the working volume of the lamp! Only natural spawn will be prevented.
The Lamp has a bigger range by default (64 blocks) since the lamps intended use is to reduce annoyances like massive squid swarms spawning around your ocean base etc.

Compiled binaries are available on [Curseforge](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/torchmaster).
If you want the latest bleeding edge version of the mod, you may get it from my [Jenkins](https://build.xalcon.net) server.
