# TorchMaster
This mod adds the **Mega Torch**, a special torch that prevents hostile mobs from spawning in a configurable radius around the torch.
The idea of this mod originates from the **Magnum Torch** (ExtraUtilities by [RWTema](https://github.com/rwtema)).

In version 1.1 the mod also adds the **Terrain Lighter**, a block that lights up the terrain around the block using torches and some furnace fuel.

Compiled binaries are available on [Curseforge](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/torchmaster).
If you want the latest bleeding edge version of the mod, you may get it from my [Jenkins](https://build.xalcon.net) server.
